Project Leader: Hugh Smithies

Project title: Identifying geologically plausible populations in whole-rock geochemical
datasets

Project objective: Given a comprehensive geochemical dataset of igneous rocks of
broadly similar type, from a geographically well-constrained region, and guidelines
outlining the ‘characteristics’ expected of geologically plausible geochemical
populations, apply machine learning and other analytical and visualisation techniques to
group geochemical analyses (i.e. rocks) into potentially related populations.
